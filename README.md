# discordLeagueBot
A bot that accesses your league id and sees if the last game you played was in your favor or not

Goal: A discord prompt that when you enter your username or have a linked league of legends acount it will
automatically go through everyone in your last game and perform a calculation based on each players individual
win rates in your gamemode as well as their champion winrate. It will then use this information and assign a total 
win chance to each team. If you win a game with a higher win chance assigned to you everything is in order
but if you win a game where the odds are against you, you have defied the odds and won a game you shouldn't have.
The same applies to losing a game in alignment with the odds and against the odds.
Once that is determined the bot will output an appropriate message to the discord chat it is in.
